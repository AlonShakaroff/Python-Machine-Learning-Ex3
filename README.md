## About

Authored by: Alon Shakaroff & Ravid Yael

## Desricpition
The goal of this exercise is to explore the dataset a bit, get some insights about important attributes of survivors and build an end-to-end machine learning model which predicts the survival of passengers on board the Titanic.
In this exercise, we first explore the data, and then try to predict the survival odds.
